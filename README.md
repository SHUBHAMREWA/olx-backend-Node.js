🔧 Backend Setup
🛠️ First, I set up the backend using Node.js and Express.js.

🗄️ For database, I connected MongoDB using Mongoose.
I also created a .env file to store the MongoDB connection URL securely.
🔗 Mongoose: https://mongoosejs.com/

📁 I followed the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to keep the project clean and organized:

📄 Models folder for MongoDB schemas.

🧠 Controllers folder for main logic like login and signup.

🔗 Routes folder to define all API endpoints.

🔐 For authentication:

I created Login and Signup APIs using Express.

All requests from frontend are sent using the Axios library, and responses are handled properly.
